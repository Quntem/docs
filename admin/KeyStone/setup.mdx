## Team or Organization?

Depending on your needs, you can either set up Quntem KeyStone for a team or an organization.

### Team

A team is designed for smaller groups of users, such as a small team of developers or a small team of designers. They will not have a verified domain, and cannot create internal apps. This option will not require help for your IT department.

### Organization

An organization is designed for larger groups of users, such as a large team of developers or a large team of designers. They will need a domain with permissions to modify DNS records. This option will require help for your IT department to verify your domain. With this option, you will be able to create internal apps.
